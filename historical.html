	History of Prisons
	</div>
		<div class="text3">
		<strong> Prisons have been around for a very long time, ever since there were laws there were people who 
		broke them, and thus places or ways to deal with these people. Prisons have changed drastically over
		the years, from ancient midieval toture chambers to the prisons we have today. Prisons in America have 
		also changes drastically over the years. One example is solitary confinement. It was taken away at one 
		point because of its barbaric nature but it is back now. </strong>

	Future of Prisons
	</div>
		<div class="text4">
		<strong> Prisons are going to be around forever. As long as there are laws, there will be people who break 
		them. Prisons should not be for punishing people though, they should be for rehabilitating people into
		society and helping make sure they have the tools and willpower to not commit any more crimes in the 
		future. Our prison system right now is about punishment. It is about getting rid of the people society
		does not like, and that is a bad system. Prisons in the future must help prisoners and others, not hurt 
		then.</strong>
