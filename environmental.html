	What It Costs
	</div>
		<div class="text3">
		<strong> It costs a lot of money to send someone to prison, and even more to keep someone there.
		on average it costs about $30,000 to send one person to prison. That is $30,000 taxpayer dollars 
		that could be spent helping restore roads, parks, help the education system, etc. Not only that, 
		but it costs $60,000 to keep a prisoner in prison, that is on food, housing, etc. Again this is 
		money that could be spent on more productive means.</strong>

	Rehabilitation
	</div>
		<div class="text4">
		<strong> Prisons in the modern-era in America are all about keeping prisoners in and punishing them,
		keeping them away from the public eye, so people do not have to worry about them. Prisons should be 
		about making sure the prisoners are well-equipped once they pay their debt to society, the should 
		be rehabilitated into society. Although it would cost more per prisoner, it is much better in the 
		long run because it keeps prisoners from committing crimes the second they are let out of prison, 
		thus saving a lot of money in the long term.</strong>
