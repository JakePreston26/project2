		<strong> Many many people are affected by mass incarceration, however there are certain groups of people
		that are affected much more than other groups. People with mental illnesses are severely in danger of 
		incarceration. There are over 2 million people with mental illnesses sent to prison every year. 15% of men
		and 30% of women in prison have mental illnesses. When these people are incarcerated they do not get the
		medical help they need and get worse. People with Mental Illnesses are some of the biggest victims of mass
		incarceration in America, and this issue needs to be addressed. </strong>

		<strong> Poor people are some of the largest victims of mass incarceration as well. Boys born into the bottom
		10% of earners are 20 times more likely to be but in prison than children born in the top 10%. Income is
		a major factor that determines how likely you are to be sent to prison. Poor people are unable to afford
		a good lawyer, while rich people can afford lengthy trials and good lawyers. Race and segregation also play 
		a large role in incarceration. "Neighborhoods with high rates of poverty and large shares of black or American 
		Indian residents have even higher rates of incarceration than incomes alone would predict."(Quartz).</strong>
